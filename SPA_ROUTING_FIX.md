# SPA Routing Fix for Deployment

## Problem
When refreshing pages like `/catalog`, `/admin/login`, etc., the server returns 404 errors because it tries to find actual files at those paths instead of serving the React SPA.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. _redirects file (Netlify/Render)
Created `/public/_redirects` with:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
This tells the server to serve `index.html` for all routes and let React Router handle client-side routing.

### 2. 404.html fallback
Created `/public/404.html` that redirects to the main app as a backup.

### 3. Build Configuration
The Vite build process will include these files in the `dist` folder during deployment.

## How it works
1. User visits `/catalog` directly or refreshes the page
2. Server looks for `/catalog` file, doesn't find it
3. `_redirects` rule catches this and serves `/index.html` instead
4. React app loads and React Router handles the `/catalog` route
5. Correct component renders

## Deployment Notes
- Render.com supports `_redirects` files
- Make sure to rebuild and redeploy after these changes
- Test all routes after deployment by refreshing pages directly
