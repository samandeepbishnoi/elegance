# SPA Routing Fix for Deployment

## Problem
When refreshing pages like `/catalog`, `/admin/login`, etc., the server returns 404 errors or redirects to landing page because it tries to find actual files at those paths instead of serving the React SPA.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. _redirects file (Render.com)
Updated `/public/_redirects` with:
```
# SPA routing for React app
/api/*  https://elegance-backend.onrender.com/api/:splat  200
/*      /index.html   200
```
This tells the server to:
- Proxy API calls to the backend
- Serve `index.html` for all other routes and let React Router handle client-side routing

### 2. render.yaml Configuration
Created `render.yaml` for explicit Render.com configuration:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: elegance-frontend
    env: static
    buildCommand: npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
        destination: /index.html
```

### 3. Enhanced 404.html Fallback
Updated `/public/404.html` to preserve the current URL using sessionStorage instead of redirecting to `/`.

### 4. Client-side Route Restoration
Modified `src/main.tsx` to restore the intended route when the app loads after a 404 redirect.

## How it works
1. User visits `/catalog` directly or refreshes the page
2. Render.com's routing configuration or `_redirects` serves `/index.html`
3. If that fails, `404.html` preserves the URL in sessionStorage and redirects to `index.html`
4. React app loads and `main.tsx` restores the intended route
5. React Router handles the `/catalog` route and shows the correct component

## Deployment Notes
- Render.com supports both `_redirects` files and `render.yaml` configuration
- The `render.yaml` file provides explicit routing configuration
- Make sure to rebuild and redeploy after these changes
- Test all routes after deployment by refreshing pages directly

## Files Modified
- `/public/_redirects` - Primary routing configuration
- `/public/404.html` - Fallback that preserves URLs
- `/src/main.tsx` - Client-side route restoration
- `/render.yaml` - Explicit Render.com configuration
